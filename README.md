# Draw ncov-19 map

The project ends at 2020-05-01, because the site we fetched data from is updated to a mobile app.
Adding that it shows that the ncov-19 is stopping spread largely.
As a result, I will stop fetch data from the new site.

I thereby hope the world will never suffer it again.

May peace and healthy for everyone.
